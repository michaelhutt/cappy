**This is not finished. It is barely started. I wrote it to teach myself about
Qt.**

 * The finalize button doesn't do anything.
 * The the calculation for 'average' color is just silly.
 * I have a feeling that this will end up as a Qt/OpenCV hybrid.

Future Work:
 * Organic cap placement with an edge detector (canny/HOG) and a naive fill
algorithm.
 * Implement a 'dominant color' algorithm, instead of average color.
 * Limit number of colors (color binning).
 * Implement image segmentation (a la: http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~jwdavis/Publications/cvpr11a.pdf)
 * Give a useful summary:
   * Listing of caps needed (how many of each color).
   * How big the surface area will need to be.
   * How much beer money you will throw away on this project.
   * Animations, because why not?
